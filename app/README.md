# CPT-188 Lab Two
## *Charlotte Childers*

This project follows along with the GeoQuiz application
created in Chapter one with the additional challenge of:

> For this challenge, customize the toast to show at the top instead of the bottom of the screen. To change how the toast is displayed, use the Toast classâ€™s setGravity function. Use Gravity.TOP for the gravity value.

Unfortunately Apps targeting API level `Build.VERSION_CODES#R` (API Level 30) or higher will not be able to use this method.

The code I used will work in older versions `ex. API(29) / Build.VERSION_CODES#Q`.

```kotlin
trueBtn.setOnClickListener{view:View ->
            val toast = Toast.makeText(
             this,
             R.string.correct_toast,
             Toast.LENGTH_SHORT
         )
            toast.setGravity(Gravity.TOP, 0, 0)
            toast.show()
        }
//This was done respectively for each button.
```

- `data class Question.kt` was added preemptively in preparation for the next lab; this addition does not interfere with
  the app's ability to run "as is".
